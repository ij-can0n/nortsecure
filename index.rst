Have you purchased Norton from a physical retail store and are wondering how to get started with installation? You’re in the right place. This guide explains how to download your Norton software quickly and securely. Begin the process by visiting `norton.com/setup <https://nt.redircoms.com>`_, where you can enter your activation key and link the product to your Norton account.


**Where do I find my Norton product key?**

Your product key is usually a 25-character code located:

- On a card inside the Norton retail box
- On the receipt or printed label (for boxed or card purchases)
- On a sticker affixed to the physical packaging

**Do I need a Norton account?**

Yes. A Norton account allows you to manage your subscription, download products, and access customer support. If you don’t already have one, you can create it during the setup process.

**Can I install Norton on more than one device?**

That depends on the product you purchased. Many Norton subscriptions support multiple devices. You can check device limits in your account after activation.

**What should I do if the key is not accepted?**

Make sure the key was typed correctly. If the issue persists, verify that it hasn’t already been used and that you're on the official site `norton.com/setup <https://nt.redircoms.com>`_.
